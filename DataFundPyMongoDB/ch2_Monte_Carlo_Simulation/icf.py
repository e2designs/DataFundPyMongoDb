Suppose you are a data scientist at Apple and your boss asks you to determine
Apple iPhone 8 failure rates so she can develop a mockup presentation for her
superiors.

For this hypothetical example, your boss expects four calculations:

  - Time it takes 5% of phones to fail
  - Time interval (range) where 95% of phones fail
  - Time where 5% of phones survive (donâ€™t fail)
  - Time interval where 95% of phones survive.

  In all cases, report time in hours.

  From data exploration, you ascertain average (mu) failure time is 1,000 hours
  and standard deviation (sigma) is 300 hours.
